# blaupunkt-RC10-emu-arduino
Emulator for Blaupunkt RC10 remote control using Arduino
I needed this to make custom control buttons to change volume, track etc.
The custom buttons can be in the form of steering wheel controls or any other ergonomically placed controls.
I used this library to receive input from rotary encoders which would control the volume of the headunit.
